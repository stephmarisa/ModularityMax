# ModularityMax
This code snippet implements Modularity based Clustering on a networkx graph with k clusters as the input. This process is also known as Modularity Maximization. This was part of a project for a network analysis course in my undergrad. I chose to implement different community detection methods(Modularity Maximization being one of them) since I love data driven projects that combine some math theory with computer science. While this code snippet is pretty technical and a bit math heavy, it demonstrates the power of analyzing networks through different types of community detection. A lot of data (particularly social data) can be represented by networks, and being able to represent these data sets in such a way is incredibly useful in finding patterns and meaning in often times overwhelming data. By looking at nodes and edges in a particular graph, we are able to perform operations such as Modularity Maximization on these graphs to discover communities and "closeness" within an overwhelming dataset.
